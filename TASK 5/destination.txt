The program is designed to copy the contents of one file to another while displaying the source file's content on the console. 
It begins by prompting the user to input the names of the source and destination files. 
Using file handling techniques, it opens the source file in read mode and the destination file in write mode. 
For each line read from the source file, it simultaneously prints the line to the console and writes it to the destination file, ensuring a line-by-line transfer. 
The program includes error handling to manage scenarios where files cannot be opened, displaying appropriate error messages. 
Finally, upon successfully copying the contents, it closes both files and notifies the user of the successful operation. 
This demonstrates key programming concepts such as file handling, input/output operations, and error handling in C++.
